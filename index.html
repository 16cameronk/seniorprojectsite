							<strong> Description: </strong> <br>
Tap your screen to bounce the basketball and get it through the hoop to unlock the barriers. Like basketball, collect 2 points for every basket you make, get three point for going underneath the hoop. Bounce too high, miss the hoop, or fall to the ground and Game Over.<br><br>

							<strong>Platforms: </strong>  Android, iPhone, Web <br><br>

<strong>Process: </strong> <br>
This was the third game I made. This game was by far the most complex game I’ve made. I wanted to make a game similar to those on the market, with an in-game store. I reused the code from Flappy LREI. The basic structure of the game was made. I then added a new element, the whistle. The whistle acted like coins. I programmed it to appear randomly on the page, and if collided with, add it to the player’s bank. The bank stored the whistle amounts and then I designed 9 different basketball types. Each new basketball type was worth 100 whistles. This was made to motivate the player to keep playing my game and collect all the basketballs. This game was the most code-intensive, however, the main challenge was design. I tried to design a relevant logo, using the basketball as O’s. Creating a background that fit with the game but made everything clear was quite hard. I drew the background in the Mac version of Paint. The game isn’t completely fluid in design but it works in functionality. I spent much time designing and coding, so this game took the most amount of time to create and even longer to get published to the App and Play stores. I also tried to put ads on this game but the process became too complicated and I will try again during my free time in the future.

<strong>Process: </strong> <br>
The goal of this game was to make a very simple and addictive game. I believe this game has the most potential to be popular. I’ve gotten best feedback when I did beta testing amongst my friends. Zero was a fusion of the popular games Color Switch and Pop the Lock.
<br><br>

I used the primary colors–Blue, Red, Green, and I picked Orange over Yellow– as the four main colors of the game. Through online research, I repurposed the code for a wheel of fortune game to make the spinning wheel and clicker work. I then assigned each color an id and randomly selected an id for the clicker. I then made wheel alternate the direction of motion by simply changing one line of code. I was able to make the game available for web in a day and a half. I left background as my favorite shade of blue and drew a triangle as shadow and began packaging the game for mobile platforms.</p>

							<strong> Description: </strong> <br>
 Flappy LREI is an LREI clone of the popular game Flappy Bird. Tap the screen to keep the LREI bird in motion and navigate through the barriers. What’s your high score? <br><br>

							<strong>Platforms: </strong> Android, iPhone, iPad, Web <br><br>

<strong>Process: </strong> <br>

This game was my first. Flappy Bird was a very popular game. This game is very simple but very addictive and the developer gained a lot of popularity and prosperity from it. Because it was very popular, there are many tutorials on how to make a similar game. I followed multiple tutorials to clone the game. I came across several challenges while developing the LREI version of the game. The first challenge was visualizing the game. How would it look? What would the barriers be? What’s the background? Does the game concept make sense? Working through those questions led me to make different versions of the game. The first Flappy LREI concept had the LREI logo “flap” through characters I drew– traditional angry teachers with rulers in their hand.  Since LREI is progressive, the idea was to get past the barriers of traditional teaching. However, when I showed people the game, that idea wasn’t clear. I took a break to work on the design. I did not have Photoshop, so I hand drew logos and text and scanned it into the computer. I then used online photo editing software to put wings onto the LREI sign. I then decided to keep the game simple and use the pipes as barriers. I changed the color to red and put words such as oppression and intersectionality which are terms that are often discussed in school. I received positive feedback from this version and I began working on publishing the game to the Play and App Store. </p>

							<strong> Description: </strong> <br>
 Swipe is a simple strategy and reflex game. Swipe in any direction: left, right, up or down to avoid the ghosts, or else game over. What's your high score? <br><br>

							<strong>Platforms: </strong> Android, iPhone<br><br>

<strong>Process: </strong> <br>
This game is a fusion of  the games  Pac-Man and Tic Tac Toe. The player is confined to a 3 by 3 grid, trying to accumulate points/food while avoiding ghosts. This was the second game I developed. I used this game to specialize in the mobile platform library the Unity game engine provided. This is why this game does not work on a computer. I used the Swipe gesture input Unity provided and more spent time reading documentation then building. This game is bare, it has no title screen, logo or instructions page. I used a simple gradient background. I focused more on using the swipe gestures and learning how to program colliding events which was useful to know in programming my games later. The main challenge was learning how to keep and store a player’s score. I browsed through open source repositories to find code, but that method did not work. Unity provided an example which I had to edit and play with but eventually I overcame this barrier. I spent 20 minutes making simple characters, I smiley face and ghosts and scanned it into the computer. This game isn’t my favorite but I learned the most through this game. A lot of principles and code from this game was used later in the games I made after. </p>

													<strong> Description: </strong> <br>
 Control the two monkeys at the same time. Tap or swipe the left side of the screen to control the left monkey and Tap or swipe the ride side of the screen to control the ride monkey. Collect all the bananas and avoid the lions.  What's your high score? <br><br>

							<strong>Platforms: </strong>  Android, iPhone, iPad, Web<br><br>

<strong>Process: </strong> <br>
							
							This game is one of my favorites. Inspired by the game 2 Cars published by Ketchapp,  2 Monkeys was a harder game to develop. First, I did research on how to program multi-touch gestures. There was great documentation and the example code I found online provided the basic structure of game. In Unity, I coded the colliding event with the lions and monkeys and programmed the speed. I then used the code from prior projects to had a high score. The original game with circles and dots, but I wanted to make the game more interesting. I spent two days drawing the monkeys, bananas, and lions and editing them using online photo software. I used the lions as the enemy and the monkeys as the player. The main challenge was making the game appear in motion. I eventually settled for the falling effect and used a gradient background. However, in the future, I hope to update the background and make the characters appear as if they are moving forward, rather than falling.</p>

							This game was built off the concepts behind Zero. Because Zero was popular amongst those who tried it, I kept with the ideas of simplicity and color matching. There are several games similar to Catch the Ice Cream, so I curated similar repositories to make the game. Coding the game was not hard part of this game. I spent more time designing the elements of the game. I believe that Catch the Ice Cream is the best graphically designed game I’ve created. Because coding was the main concern, I was able to design the cones and scoops of ice cream , and plan the layout the of the game better than any other. I was also able to make a nice logo and icon for the game. The goal of this game was to look as professional as possible. Catch the Ice Cream was also the fastest game to submit to the App Store, it was approved in two days, despite Apple being notoriously known for taking up to a week to get approved.
